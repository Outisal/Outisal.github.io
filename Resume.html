    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>I’m a result-oriented supply chain professional with experience in  S&OP process implementation and development as well as operational experience in demand, supply and material planning. I’m a numbers geek who likes to dive deep into the world of systems and tools and sell ideas with facts. During the last six years I have grown familiar with Relex and SAP. Currently I’m working in supply chain development and my main project is the implementation of a new S&OP tool. 
    Although geeky I’m a very social person and I don’t shy away from leadership. My latest team reached the top scores in a workplace wellbeing assessment. The highest grades came from the  following statements: “My manager has the courage to go after the most challenging issues” and “My team has good team spirit”.</p>
